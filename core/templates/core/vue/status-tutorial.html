      <md-dialog-title>Hi! :) Welcome to Analysis Pipeline Status Page.</md-dialog-title>

      <md-dialog-content>
      <p>
        This is <b>BETA</b>, and there are still a lot of work to be done.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>So, what is this and why do I need this in my life?</h5>
      <p>
        I spent a lot of time on it and hopefully it means something in your life :( <br>
        This page exists to help you track status of analyses.<br>
        We reckon that it is slightly inconvenient to have multiple pages open to track analyses,
        so we came up with this page to display all related information from different sources.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Cool, how do I use it?</h5>
      <p>
        If you work on a wetlab located in 3rd floor, just press
      <button class="project-button" squared><span>Wetlab</span></button>
        located on left menu.
        This should load all the analyses that are:<br>
        <b>1. Updated within last two weeks.</b><br>
        <b>2. Related to sequencings with mismatching number of lanes to requested lane number.</b><br>
        <b>3. Library has to be post-2019</b><br><br>
        But let's say you want to create your own list.<br>
        Then simply click  <md-icon>add</md-icon> located in lower left corner. <br>
        This will take you to <b>ProjectTag</b> create page.<br>
        <b>ProjectTag</b> is a new model we came up with. It currently only has 2 fields: Title and samples. 
        You set the title and add all the samples you want to attach, then the table will be populated with all the analyses 
        attached to that samples.<br>
        Similarly, use <md-icon>remove</md-icon> to remove <b>ProjectTag</b>.<br>
        It does not auto refresh at the moment.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Your table is weird and ugly, and I do not understand it</h5>
      <p>Let us now look at how we interpret the table.</p>
      <h6>Colour of the rows</h6>
      <p>
        Ok firstly if the row is pretty mint green<br>
        <b-button squared class="row-button sample-name" style="background-color: #c8e6c5">CoolMintyGreen</b-button>
        That means the data for the library is <b>imported.</b><br>
        This one on the other hand is depressing grey.
        <b-button squared class="row-button sample-name" style="background-color: #f2f2f2">UglyGrey</b-button>
        This one is <b>not imported.</b><br>
        For an analysis to be considered imported, it needs to have lane number equal or greater than requested number of lanes.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6>Give me Filter</h6>
      <p>
        Analysis Status table offers some basic filtering functions. Try clicking<br>
        <md-button>Filter <md-icon>filter_list</md-icon></md-button> 
        to see what options of filters are avaliable.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6>Pipeline Status</h6>
      <p>
        So you can see 2 columns named <b>Pipeline</b> and <b>Pseudobulk</b>.<br>
        These two columns fetch analysis status from Tantalus and highlight badges accordingly.<br>
        What do each colours represent then?:<br>
        <b-badge variant="secondary">Not found</b-badge>
        <b-badge variant="primary">Archiving</b-badge>
        <b-badge variant="success">Complete</b-badge>
        <b-badge variant="info">Running</b-badge>
        <b-badge variant="dark">Idle</b-badge>
        <b-badge variant="danger">Error</b-badge><br>
        We will add a hover over the cell to show this information.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6>I want Montage</h6>
      <p>
        If the Montage is marked as <b-button squared class="row-button ln110">N/A</b-button>, analysis is not yet uploaded to Montage.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6>This is not enough, I demand more.</h6>
      <p>
        Yes this is incomplete at the moment, these things will be added soon:<br>
        <b>
          1. Column  Sorting<br>
          2. Search<br>
          3. Faster Loading<br>
          4. ProjectTag Edit<br>
        </b>
        If you notice that something is broken, or want something more, please contact the dev team.
        <br>
        <small>Or idk maybe people will utterly hate this page and we will just remove and it throw away undone. Like many other things in my life.</small>
